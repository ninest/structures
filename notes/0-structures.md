# Structures

A **data structure** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

- Help manage and organize data
- Make code cleaner and easier to understand

An **abstract data type** (ADT) is an abstraction of data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS)                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List              | Dynamic array <br>linked list                                       |
| Queue             | Linked list based queue <br>Array based queue <br>Stack based queue |
| Map               | Tree map <br>Hash map/table                                         |

A vehicle can be an ADT (the abstraction) while cars and bikes are the DSs (the implementation).
