Arrays are the fundamental building block of most other data structures.

## Static array

A static array is a **fixed length** container containing n elements **indexable** from the range [0, n-1].

Indexable means that each slot or index in the array can be referenced with a number.

Static arrays are given continguous chunks of memory. All addresses are adjacent,

#### Uses
- Sorting anc accessing sequential data
- Temporarily storing objects
- Used by IO routines as buffers
- Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
- Used to return multiple values from a function
- In dybamic programming to cache answers to subproblems.
