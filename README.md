# Data-Structures

**linkedlist.py**  
```append(), erase() length(), display(), get()  ```

**stack.py**  
```push(), pop(), size(), is_empty(), display()```


Currenlty, only linked lists have been implemented in Python, although the code is being refactored. Stacks will also be added as another abstract data structure for python.
